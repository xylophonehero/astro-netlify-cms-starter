# ABOUT

I have been an athlete, specifically a high jumper, for over 15 years in which time I have competed internationally and also won the AAA's English championships 3 times. I have also been on TV to compete on the show "Ninja Warrior UK" where I beat "The Wall" and managed to qualify for the semi-finals! Along my athletics career I have developed a keen interest in the human body, its anatomy and, specifically, the muscles therein. This eventually led me into the world of sports massage. A practice where I aspire to learn more and more about the body and its working muscles, and of course to help people attain the physical well-being they deserve.
